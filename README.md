<h1 align="center" id="title">Text Classification for Crime Data</h1>

<p id="description">This project focuses on building a text classification model to analyze and categorize crime-related data based on text descriptions. It involves preprocessing textual data exploratory data analysis and training a Bidirectional LSTM-based neural network to predict crime categories.</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning tokenization stemming and padding for uniform input.
- Category Encoding: Encoding textual categories into numerical formats for model compatibility.
- Model Architecture: A Bidirectional LSTM network with dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluation using accuracy F1-score and recall for robust performance assessment.
